# Jupyterhub Dockers

These dockers were created to support our [JupyterHub Deployment](https://github.com/learlab/development-server).

## Base-nlp

This image comes with the basic workflow tools we use in our lab such as git, GitHub CLI, and a GitHub GUI extension for the JupyterLab interface.

The image also comes preloaded with the correct version of CUDA and CUDA-enabled distributions of PyToch, SpaCy, and Huggingface's Transformers.

## r-studio

This image comes with the r-essentials for completing statistical work, as well as some compilers that are required for installing additional R packages.
